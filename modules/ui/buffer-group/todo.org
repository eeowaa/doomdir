#+title: Buffer-Group

* Documentation [0/5]
** TODO Buffer name regexps vs. major modes
Sometimes buffers are displayed before the major mode is set. In these cases,
major modes in buffer group definitions will not be checked in order to
determine where to display the buffer. Therefore, it is good to define buffer
groups based on buffer name regexps as well as major modes. I have not found
another workaround.

** TODO Incompatibility with =:ui popup=
** TODO Order is important in ~display-buffer-alist~
** TODO Use of the ~window-sides-vertical~ option
** TODO Migrate reference documentation from private config
* Configuration [0/5]
** TODO Split =buffer-group.el= into multiple files
One file for buffer groups, another file for display rules. Should also include
a file explaining how to use the package.

** TODO Define buffer groups in =config.el=
** TODO Define display rules when =+defaults= is given
** TODO Add =+all= flag to set ~switch-to-buffer-obey-display-actions~
** TODO Add =+hacks.el= file
* Features [0/4]
** TODO Improve syntax of ~buffer-group-define~ macro
** TODO Interactive functions to add and remove conditions to buffer groups
I would like to make ~buffer-group-property-pushnew~ interactive and allow the
user to select a regexp (defaulting to the current buffer's name) and/or a major
mode (defaulting to the current buffer's major mode) to add as a condition to an
existing buffer group. I would also like to allow interactive selection of a
buffer group.

Beyond that, I would like to create a new function named
~buffer-group-property-remove~ and allow interactive selection of the buffer
group and condition(s).

** TODO Interactive ~display-buffer-alist~ setup for buffer groups
I would like to create a function that allows users to interactively select a
buffer group and a corresponding ~display-buffer-alist~ action for that buffer
group. Before that can happen, I'll need to lay some groundwork for the creation
and management of such actions. Perhaps another alist?

** TODO Prevent other buffers from appearing in side window slots
Refer to ~+popup/quit-window~ for inspiration.
