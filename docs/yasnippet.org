#+TITLE: Yasnippet development and usage

* Documentation
Look for Org files in the =doc/= subdirectory of the =yasnippets= package
directory. You can do this manually as follows:

1. =C-c C-l= (~find-library~)
2. =yasnippet RET=
3. =SPC .= (~find-file~)
4. =doc RET=

Otherwise, you can just run this code to open a listing of those Org files in a
=dired= buffer:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
(find-dired (concat (file-name-directory (file-truename (find-library-name "yasnippet")))
                    "doc")
            "-type f -name '*.org'")
#+end_src

* Variables
+ ~doom-snippets-dir~
+ ~+snippets-dir~
