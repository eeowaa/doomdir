#+TITLE: Generic project-based development workflow
This document outlines a generic workflow that can be followed for any
development project.

* DONE Starting a new project
1. Create the project directory using =M-x mkdir=
2. Register the project using =SPC p a= (~projectile-add-known-project~)
3. Initialize the git repo using =SPC g c r= (~magit-init~)

* DONE Contextualizing the work
1. Create a simple =README.org= using =SPC f f= (~counsel-find-file~)
   - Briefly describe the project objective
   - Define the scope of the first iteration

2. Similarly, create a =todo.org= and list a few tasks that come to mind
   - Feel free to use this very file as a template
   - Add categories and tags to organize your work:
     | File          | Heading               |
     |---------------+-----------------------|
     | ~#+CATEGORY:~ | ~:CATEGORY:~ property |
     | ~#+FILETAGS:~ | standard tag          |

3. Add the tasks to your Org Agenda
   - If you want the tasks to appear alongside the rest of your projects, run
     =C-c [= (~org-agenda-file-to-front~), which will add =todo.org= to
     ~org-agenda-files~ by the Customize interface and stored in the file
     specified by ~custom-file~.

   - On the other hand, if you'd rather focus in on the project and/or not deal
     with Customize, you can use =SPC u C-c C-x <= (~org-set-restriction-lock~)
     to restrict the agenda to tasks in =todo.org=. Relevant keybindings:
     | Binding           | Description         |
     |-------------------+---------------------|
     | =SPC u C-c C-x <= | restrict to file    |
     | =C-c C-x <=       | restrict to subtree |
     | =C-c C-x >=       | remove restriction  |

* TODO Configure git
1. If you would like to set your author name and email to something other than
   the global default, either edit the local gitconfig file using =SPC g f g=
   (~magit-find-git-config-file~) or just use shell commands:
   #+begin_src sh
   # For commit messages
   git config user.name eeowaa
   git config user.email 7460185+eeowaa@users.noreply.github.com
   # For forge commands
   git config github.user eeowaa
   #+end_src
2. If using =:tools magit +forge= to interact with a git remote such as GitHub,
   you will need to set up an auth token.
   - [ ] How is this done?
   - [ ] macOS keychain vs. =~/.authinfo.gpg=
3. Make your first commit via the menu invoked by =SPC g g= (~magit-status~)
   - Add files to =.gitignore= using =i= (~magit-gitignore~)

** HOLD Explain how to configure and use the =forge= commands
:LOGBOOK:
- Note taken on [2021-10-04 Mon 10:50] \\
  I currently have =:tools magit +forge= disabled.
:END:
- Allows you to use an issue tracker (e.g. GitHub Issues) instead of =todo.org=
- Bound to =SPC g '=

* TODO Language-specific boilerplate
** TODO Install interpreter
Make sure to match the local version with the version you are going to run in
production.

** TODO Install debugger (optional)
** TODO Install offline documentation
- =M-x dash-docs-install-docset=
  - Do for whatever language(s) you're working with
  - [ ] Where are they installed?
- [ ] Texinfo for Python?
  - [ ] brew command?
- [ ] Boto3?
  - There is an ~AWS_Javascript~ Dash docset but I don't see one for Boto3

** TODO Set up environment (e.g. =.env=)
** TODO Write the =.editorconfig= and optionally the =.dir-locals.el=
Example =.dir-locals.el=:
#+begin_src lisp-data
((nil (projectile-project-run-cmd . "python3.8 -m lambda_function")
      (compilation-read-command)))
#+end_src

* DONE Running the project
=projectile= provides a slew of commands for running system commands in a
project. The commands are outlined below:

| Command                          | Bindings             |
|----------------------------------+----------------------|
| ~projectile-configure-project~   | =C-c p C=, =SPC p g= |
| ~projectile-compile-project~     | =C-c p c=, =SPC p c= |
| ~projectile-test-project~        | =C-c p P=, =SPC p T= |
| ~projectile-install-project~     | =C-c p L=            |
| ~projectile-package-project~     | =C-c p K=            |
| ~projectile-run-project~         | =C-c p R=, =SPC p R= |

Once you've run a ~projectile-*-project~ command once, the system command you
entered will be cached so you can retrieve it with =M-p=
(~previous-history-element~) in the minibuffer the next time you run that elisp
command.

To skip the minibuffer prompt altogether, you can use =SPC p C=
(~projectile-repeat-last-command~) to evaluate the previously-run =projectile=
command again (and executing the corresponding system command).

** DONE Explain how to use ~projectile-edit-dir-locals~
Instead of manually entering system commands for each ~projectile-*-project~
command, you can store defaults in corresponding variables set in the
project-specific =.dir-locals.el= file. Just run =SPC p e=
(~projectile-edit-dir-locals~) and enter values for one or more
~projectile-project-*-cmd~ variables.

For example, if you set ~projectile-project-compile-cmd~ to ~"make"~ in a
Makefile-based project, running =SPC p c= will still prompt you for a
compilation command, but the minibuffer will be prepopulated with ~make~. This
allows you to pass additional flags to ~make~ before running.

** DONE Explain how to run project in an interactive shell
Any of the =projectile-*-project= commands used to run a project can be
interactive. All you have to do is set the corresponding
~projectile-*-use-comint-mode~ variable to ~t~.
